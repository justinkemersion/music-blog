*Listening vibe: barely awake, calm, dreamy, atmospheric, cinematic*

With AI-generated playlists fueling my music discovery, I’ve unearthed a trove of new-to-me gems. One that stands out is Aphex Twin’s *Selected Ambient Works Volume II* (1994), specifically the track “#3,” which I’m spinning as I write. Known as Richard David James, Aphex Twin is a sonic alchemist whose ethereal sound can slip past at first. This new-to-me introspective ambient vibe is a rare find I’ve been chasing, pulsing with a heartbeat akin to Brian Eno or Boards of Canada. *Selected Ambient Works Volume II* was crafted in James’ Cornwall studio, using custom-built synths in lucid dream-inspired sessions, giving “#3” an otherworldly glow—perfect for late-night drifts. AI’s curated nudges keep me eager to dig deeper.
