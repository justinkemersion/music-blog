*Listening vibe: late summer dusk*

While digging through my ~/Music library, I rediscovered **Vetiver’s “Maureen”** (2006), a track that’s pure understated magic. Vetiver, a San Francisco folk outfit, crafts songs with a hazy, pastoral glow. What makes “Maureen” shine is its gentle acoustic strum and Andy Cabic’s soft vocals, like a warm breeze through an open window. It’s perfect for unwinding on a porch at dusk. Fans of José González or Iron & Wine will love its intimate vibe.
